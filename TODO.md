## Infrastructure

- [x] Create a team GitHub
- [x] Create GitHub repo for website notes
- [ ] Figure out where the website is served
- [ ] Set up Backup or GitHub sync (via some plugin)
- [x] (canceled) Add
      [WordPress GitHub Sync](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-github-sync/)
  - This plugin does not work with organization repos
- [ ] Hide wp-admin page -
      https://www.3nions.com/hide-wp-admin-page-wordpress-login/

## General

- [x] (canceled) Unpublish all the nonessential pages, then slowly add it back
  - We should just keep things up.
- [x] Favicon
- [ ] Sharper favicon (current one is too small to distinguish)
- [x] (2020-09-19) Rearrange headers (navbar)
  - [x] (2020-09-19) Merge "About Us" with "Our Team" and "Resources"
- [ ] Instagram and Facebook feed -- Currently shows up on a lot of pages, which
      is weird
  - [x] (2020-09-19) Remove from pages (it looks awkward)
  - [ ] Fix Instagram
  - [ ] Fix Facebook
  - [ ] Only put these in Gallery section, not everywhere
- [ ] Heading styles are weird
  - [ ] H1 is tiny
  - [ ] H2 should be larger
  - [ ] H3 could be a bit smaller
- [ ] Hamburger does not work on thin screen
- [ ] Move logo into main header
- [ ] Update quick links
- [ ] Remove tab sets and Darko plugin
- [ ] Clean up (remove) draft pages
- [ ] Consider a move to a Jekyll + Bootstrap website
  - We will have to make it super easy for non-coding users to use. The most
    they should have to know is how to use Markdown; even better would be to
    have them write things in Google Docs and have it automatically show up on
    the website.

## Pages

### Home

- [x] Move contact form somewhere else?
  - Removed, just see "Contact Us" page
- [x] VGSA news has nothing under it
  - Removed
- [x] Events?
  - Link is still good; now fix the events page itself
- [ ] Find new pictures (current ones outdated)
- [ ] Put blog posts instead of just images (solves above)

### About Us

- [x] Change descriptions of senators
- [x] (2020-09-18) Fix Interested in Joining VGSA section here:
      <http://vgsa.usc.edu/role-senators/> (seems hard to change)
- [ ] Update eligibility requirements for roles (Sebastian)
- [ ] Make it clear that E-Board members are GSG senators
- [ ] Update council members and senators with all their info
- [ ] Merge "Current Council" and "Past Council"?

### Events

- [ ] Remove pages for Signature Events and Department Events
- [ ] Switch to a Google Calendar that we update from time to time
- [x] (canceled) Use a list of events on the Events page of the website rather
      than a calendar
  - We can use Google Calendar

### Gallery

- [ ] Make the Instagram feed the main feature of this page, since that is what
      we update

### Funding

- [x] Move Funding Request page from Resources to Events tab, "Events Funding"
- [x] Move the Funding Policies content from the document to the page
  - [x] Exclude last line (Note) in document
